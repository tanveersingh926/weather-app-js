# Weather App using ReactJS

As requested, I have build this project without using any UI library.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Test Cases

I wrote some unit test cases using React Testing Library just to demonstrate the use of testing library. Due to time constraint I was not able to add Cypress tests
